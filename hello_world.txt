Hello world. 
Let's learn how to do computers.
I understand a little bit.
I'm working through the git tutorial again, because I installed a new OS.
I was using an old macOS on this Macbook, but it could no longer take updates.
I finally decided to install linuxmint as the sole OS on the machine.
I ran dual boot for a week or so, but with the old macOS, it was pointless.
